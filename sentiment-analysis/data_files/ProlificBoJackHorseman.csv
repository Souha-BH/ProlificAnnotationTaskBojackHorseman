What's the one thing that Princess doesn't have and is increasingly less likely to have due to age? Children.  Perhaps subconsciously PC is willing to play along with ""Vincent"" and the deception because it allows her to have three children.   She doesn't pursue a physical relationship or ask him to wear anything that would break the illusion so she can maintain the fantasy, the way we indulge young children in make-believe games. it makes Princess happy. Which is her mantra for the second half of the show. 


My theory for season 2 is that eventually she'll catch on.  But the children will actually be orphans (or otherwise unattached) that she'll adopt. In a roundabout way finally having the children she'd always wanted in a life-imitates-art way a la Horsin' Around / Mr Peanutbutter's House.",TRUE,Princess Carolyn,https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Carolyn,4410,TRUE,CannabinoidAndroid,,Raccoon1,,,,,,,,2014-09-05 21:12:41,,self.BoJackHorseman,FALSE,0,,FALSE,2fl1xx,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,{},,7,,FALSE,,/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/2fl1xx/princess_carolyn_and_vincent_theory_for_season_2/,1441184989,,34,,{},,,FALSE,t5_2zzfr,,,,self,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,0,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2fl1xx,,,,,,,1409955161,,,FALSE,,,,,,

The moment Charlotte showed up and saw BoJack, I hoped that'd be it. I wanted BoJack and Charlotte to be a thing so much. I wanted all that built up tension to release, I wanted Harper to be a thing, I wanted my stupid and unrealistic Hollywood happy ending. I want this stupid, selfish, self-sabatoging, depressed Horseman to be happy because if he can do it maybe I can do it too.   
   
Then they crushed me. They managed to get my guard down and managed to get inside and convince me to have hopes and dreams for this fictional horse. Episode 11 was like a nightmare, as I had the charade revealed and saw just how much of a monster this character I'd been rooting for had really become. Then, when I was at my worst, they gave me a small ray of hope with Charlotte's stolen kiss and BoJack turning down Penny on the boat...wait, why is that door still open? Oh god damn it, no. No. NO NO NO NO NO. PLEASE NO. FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. It'd have been easier if BoJack had simply been caught in an unfortunate circumstance, but instead he was complicit in his failure so there were no excuses to hide behind. There is no rationalizing away his actions to redeem him. He has to live with the horrible thing he did and there's probably no way he'll ever rebuild the bridge he burnt.   
   
This show has torn me apart in a way that no show has ever been able to. I've been angry at character deaths, elated at victories, enthralled by other shows, but no show has ever been able to turn me inside out like this. This is without a doubt the most emotionally jarring show I've ever watched in my life, and its a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse.

[Possible spoilers all]","There's just something about this show that makes it so difficult to explain to people. It is deranged, asinine, childish, and above all, unbelievably shallow. An incredibly rich and successful person ""isn't happy with his life"" and he isn't in the limelight anymore like he used to be (even in the second season after his book becomes very successful), and that makes him ""sad."" He drinks too much and can't maintain meaningful relationships with anyone, pushing everyone who cares for him away. These are very central themes to the show and are also pathetically overdone tropes, shallow storytelling mechanics you should have figured out in your creative writing class.

And I'll be damned but this show pulls all of it together beautifully, making these characters and their live's hardships painfully meaningful. The simplicity of the drama makes it deeply human, which while obviously ironic, makes perfect sense for the world they've created. The silly jokes they play out and the subtle continuity of the world they occupy creates a gravity that ties the emotional baggage of the characters to the real world. It makes the bitter life lessons and difficult or poor decisions relatable.

So I binge watched the whole second season today. And now that it's over I tried telling myself ""okay, it's still early Cap'n, you can watch something else before you need to go to bed and still wake up in time for work tomorrow."" But I can't. My brain is completely stuck, thinking over and over what the fuck I just watched.

S2:E3 
“My moms boyfriend home-schools me. He a photographer.”
Sarah Lynn licks the fur in Herbs brief case “Its bear fur. I can tell my step dad was a bear.”
 
These two things were given no punch line, said very casually, and never touched on again (to my knowledge).  They do kinda give an implication that her step dad photographed her and quite possibly molested her. Knowing this with a couple other things from season one helped my theory.

Her mom doesn’t care about her- 
S1:E3 The only interaction we see between Sarah Lynn and her mom is negative. Her mom shoots down her dream of becoming an architect, and implies she’s here on the show only because her mom blew an agent. Overall doesn’t mean much but her mom could easily have neglected her and if found out about sexual abuse, do nothing. 

She has sex with Bojack-
Bojack might have been a total tool to her and uncaring, but  never the less could still be seen as another father figure in Sarah Lynn’s early life. Sometime sexual abuse victims will have sexual fantasies relating to their abuse. In this theory Sara Lynn was sexually abuse by her step father, recreating this fantasy would be possible by having sex with another father figure in her life, Bojack Horseman.  

http://www.orthodoxwriter.com/2012/07/indications-childhood-sexual-abuse.html, this is just article that explains some of the things I talked about. Other symptoms the article gave could be given to Sarah Lynn like addiction. 
Just a idea that I thought of. If anyone knows anything confirming or denying this theory it would be great to know.

[Spoilers],"To preface this post, I love Bojack and enjoyed this season but as I finished it and had time to reflect on the season, I feel it was incomplete?
The show is still wonderful in many ways but this season it felt there wasn't enough development in any direction; from the brilliance of episode 4 with Bojack longing for a daughter it doesn't feel like it was followed upon.  All of the side characters seem forced in and not fleshed out enough, I love PC and Mr. Peanutbutter but it didn't seem as though they were involved enough.  I also loved how grim episode 11 was it seemed to only rehash ideas we've seen before ie. Bojack is broken and wants forgiveness.  Jill Pill felt like she had a major plot line cut out based on the season 2 speculations and Bojack himself felt as though there wasn't enough development, I mean how many times can we see him wallow in self pity?  
Overall, the season felt incomplete.  Some amazing moments but missing the charm of season 1 and 2.

and now I'm sitting here wondering if PB really did forgive Bojack, because it was sort of an inverse of what what he went through with herb. Except here the suit (wanda) forced a night neat resolution instead of driving a wedge. 

Wanda also kinda knew that Bojack was suppose to lose as well. She frames it like ""thats what the people on Twitter want"", but really she knew from the start what was going to happen.

Bojack's been wallowing in his depression, drugs, and lifetime disapointments lurching from one bad decision to another, but its not those things that make him do the negative atuff he does.

He is a shitty person, and his overblown sadness, drugs and disapoinments hide him from that fact.

He is his own self fulfilling prophecy.

But to me, at least the events in S3E11 are not his fault. He is a grown up with his own decisions and so is Sarah Lynn. Also, she was the one who invited him to party with her prior.

I think Sarah Lynn was lost way before. And BoJack might have been able to save her ~10 years ago (as implied in the beginning of S3E11) but he didn't fuck her up in the first place, that was the fame.

So at least in my opinion it isn't BoJacks fault. Diane sums it up pretty well in Sarah Lynn's debut episode:

Having spent 3 seasons making her an arbitrarily bad person we finally got to see what made her who she is, and at times they made me feel very sympathetic towards her. The crossover scenes between her past and Bojacks present were some of the best in the whole show, and the way they drew parallels between her upbringing and Bojacks do an amazingly depressing job of showing how the cycle of abuse so easily continues.

Showing her mental state decline to the point where she was almost a child in some ways, and as having the capacity to love someone like she did when she was a child was so humanising. When we see Bojack throw the doll out of the window it seems sad at the time, but a couple of episodes later when they show what the doll meant to her and how she was reliving one of the most painful and formative experiences of her life was the most heart-wrenching part of the show so far in my opinion.

I have seen many of the obvious points made (the lobotomy, threatening Bea with the same, etc.) And counter points that ""he is the product of his time"" and so on.  

My point doesn't delve deep into nuance, instead I opt to make the simple observations.  I understand we are dealing with an unreliable narrator, but This guy was a selfish prick.  He demonstrates little love for his family, and little caring.  We can see it in the way he interrupts his wife and son playing piano.  Obviously this wasn't an evil act, but it hinted at his coldness, not willing to put up with his family having fun, even with his son facing deployment to war.  Also, he showed little care when his son died.  This could also be him just maintaining composure for the family, but given all the other information, I doubt it.  

Long story short, I don't think he was  so much a product of his time, as much as he is how an asshole would be at that time, in that social circle.  I don't think he spoke in the soft, friendly voice to disarm people or because he was nice.  I think he did that because that's what respected members of society did.  I think he pretty much, only cares about how he looks and is thought about by others.  I don't think he was upset at the lobotomy being more destructive than he thought (""hardly worth the effort ""), I think he was more upset that it didn't have the intended effect, she wasn't easier to manage, now she was another type of burden.

The one that jumped out to me in this latest season was in Free Churro.  

Bojack talks about the parties their family had, the ones where he had to dress up and sing the Lollipop song. While Bojack had to perform his humiliating routine, his mother performed the grand finale with a fancy dress. He described it as ""beautiful and sad,"" but mentioned that though his father hated the parties, he always came out to watch his mother dance. In Ibsen's A Doll's House, the main character practices the tarantella with her husband, who thinks of her as a child who must be lectured and scolded, a ""lark"" for his entertainment. In both shows, the husband is insufferable and selfish, holding their wives in contempt except for one moment when they dance.

Two reasons I think is that after their fight in episode 10 where after their argument she kick Bojacks (admittedly adorable) float balloon away and its supposed to be a symbolic gesture that she is letting ago of attachment with Bojack.

The second reason is all of episode 12.  Where she flat out tells him that shes done with doing anything about, for and with him. And lastly when before she drops him off to rehab she says her story about Abby (her high school friend turned cool click enemy) where she said she ""I hated her. But she was my best friend. And she needed me. And I loved her.""  And then tells Bojack that ""Now, here you are. And I hate you. But, you're my best friend. And you need me.""  And notice how she never repeated the last line to Bojack.

Now I don't think Diane wants Bojack out of her life, but she can't be with him as they are both people who need to seek help with their personal problems and they can't turn to each other since they are not equipped to deal with the others issues.

What if Flip was Princess Carolyn all along?

As Princess Carolyn herself might say: ""Oh, fish!""

You see, they seem to consistently hang around each other both during pitching the idea and executing it. It can't be a coincidence that she became a producer for this project specifically. The one time she is away from the set the entire production falls apart like no one is actually managing it. Also, how convenient is it that exactly when she went through a crisis about her baby, a project named Philbert came to her with a starring role perfect for Bojack with whom she had a recent falling out. Flip is also established as an extremely bad writer which fits Princess Carolyn and her lack of writing experience. Also, Flip talks a lot about his ""vision"" but doesn't seem to have any whatsoever. What may have actually happened is that Flip is a representation of her damaged psyche after the tough period in life PC experienced with breaking up and having another miscarriage. She hastily wrote a bad script and promoted it herself.  My theory as to how she presented as Flip to others is that Flip is actually this sort of human sized puppet/costume that she wears and puts on a voice. When she is far away she leaves the office locked and plays recordings. At the end we see everything only from PC's fractured view as the line between her and her secret identity blur until we see her as Flip desperately trying to capture her previous identity.

When I started watch I already got amazed about the looking and personality (nerd, smart, feminist, full of dreams) similarities between Diane and my GF, but as the series goes shit started to get real. How Mr.Peanutbutter always do nice things and want to impress, when he steals th ""D"" or throw a suprise party, but she hates suprises, once I sneak a chocolate bar into her home so I can make hot chocolate when she wake up and when I woke her up and say ""i made hot chocolate for you :D"" she says ""why did you do that?"" like i was wasting my time, but i have to do this, what is the point of a relationship became a routine, would be booring.

Then I realized that i was like Mr.Peanutbutter, I am nice, kind, playful and sometimes may look like I have no depth, but there are galaxies of thoughts passing through my head. I'm not perfect ok, it's not easy to deal with me sometimes too.

&gt;"" He can be very headstrong and heavily opinionated at times especially in a heated argument to the point of being borderline defensive. Despite Diane constantly voicing her dislike of them, Mr. Peanutbutter constantly tries to impress her with big gestures because he’s scared she’ll get bored of him and leave like his previous wives. There are also traces of nihilism in him. "" THIS IS SOMETHING FROM MR.PB WIKI (frighteningly similar to me)

I am in constant fear that she will left me for a work far away from me (Like Diane went do Cordovia), my girl did went to another city for summer internship (and when she's far away the comunication its like wheN Diane was in Cordovia, really shitty) but she's going again in feburary and june, even already talked about a 6 moths internship really far away, but i support her. I'm always trying not to upset her by complaining, so i swallow alot of shit i don't like.

My GF have alot of troubles to talk about her feelings, she just keep to herself and i don't have a clues what is going on her mind like Diane have it too, and sometimes she is mean for no reason, probably because of the problems with feelings. She has a bad relationship with her family too and its wierd but long story. Nowdays we are just fighting all the time, but sometimes when we are together everything feels perfect and calm and despite everything I am always nice to her.

So when I saw the last episode of Season 4 wen Diane says “it's messy, and at first glance, it doesn't seem to make any sense, and it's hard to figure out but sometimes, if you squint at it just right, everything lines up, and it's the most perfect, beautiful, amazing thing” I've never felt so related with any series like that, was amazing.

Season 5 they're not together...

Especially in light of the earlier episodes touching on sexual harassment and whether there's a point where you can't be forgiven anymore.

I think it's interesting that the show finally came out and put forth the idea that maybe we aren't supposed to like or root for Bojack, that he's been given enough chances and blown them all. He's a self destructive, Selfish and manipulative individual who's ruined people's lives time and time again, has it become too late for him?

After all the times that Bojack Horseman has made me cry, either from laughter, pity, or the general pulling at my heartstrings, there's one scene I didn't expect to be as impactful as it was for me. Season 6, ep. 2, 'The New Client' at the very end where Princess Carolyn is so exhausted she breaks down in front of her 'mortal enemy' Vanessa Gecko.

From the beginning, I expected Gecko to be ruthlessly cruel &amp; snippy to Princess Carolyn but it never came. Nothing that shes said or done while on screen has been intentionally malicious, just a strong willed woman who boasts about how happy she is. That's quite annoying but nothing that I wouldn't expect from our lame universe without underwater cities &amp; stripper dolphins. I take pride in knowing that I'll treat any &amp; everyone with respect as long as long as it's reciprocated. But there I was, a basic bitch that allowed jealousy &amp; rumors fuel my emotions. Not only was this episode empowering but it also called me out on my shit. I automatically jumped on the hating Gecko wagon because I adore PC &amp; identify with her the most but where did that get us? With egg on our face. When I heard that line, I felt such dread &amp; wanted to apologize to a fictional character for unnecessary hostility. It reminded me of a tweet, ""She's not intimidating, you're just intimidated."" That lesson didn't really resonate within me until this very scene &amp; I'm forever grateful, so I take it with me through every walk of life now.",TRUE,Princess Carolyn,https://bojackhorseman.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Carolyn,4588,FALSE,ShortAndStoned,,,,,,,,,,2020-01-26 3:38:52,,self.BoJackHorseman,FALSE,0,,,eu1k67,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,{},,6,,FALSE,,/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/eu1k67/my_favorite_line_of_the_entire_series/,1587145519,,47,,{},,,FALSE,t5_2zzfr,,,,spoiler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's comprehensive. it's clever. excellently executed. introduces all the key characters timely and touches on how they all relate to each other in a brief but precise manner. 

Not only that, we are also introduced to main characters in a way that brings to light multiple dimensions of their personality and sets the characteristic pathways from which they seldom deviate in the entire course of the show until the last episodes of the latest season. so here goes: 

Bojack Horseman: 

a washed-up 90s actor who refuses to let go of his past glory and endlessly wallows  in slef-pity, consuming self-doubt and crippling depression. has traces of narcissistic and histrionic personality traits.

Princess Carolyn: 

Bojack's ex lover/clever hollywoo agent, agentress, agentrix (what's the word grrrh) with an in-your-face kind of attitude, usually blunt but has a kind heart. doesn't harbour grudges. 

Todd: 

a happy-go-lucky harmless character with a shady past who will always be there to hype you up no matter what. sleeps on bojack's couch. 

Diane 

an intelligent, introverted and awkward writer with a friendly demeanor. supportive and very understanding. an empath. also has her moments (or bouts, if you will) of slef-doubt and feelings of being inadequate. 
dating Mr. PB but in a sexual way. 

Mr. PeanutButter 

extremely extroverted, care-free, and hyperactive. had his own show which co-incidentally resembled Horsing Around in many aspects. constantly makes efforts to become close with bojack. 

AND THE 1ST EPISODE SO BRILLIANTLY COVERS ALL OF THESE ASPECTS AND ALSO MANAGES TO DELIVER SOME OF THE MOST HILARIOUS AND WITTY JOKES OF THE ENTIRE SERIES!! truly a genius start to a genius show! 

tbh if had to choose an episode to unwind to  after getting home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, this one would be it. 

so here's to a perfect pilot episode: Bojack Horseman: The Bojack Horseman Story, Chapter One.
